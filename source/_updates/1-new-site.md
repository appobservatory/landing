App Observatory is currently in active development. Based on the Trello card, 
I think the private beta should be available by the end of March 2022. Since 
the private beta is incoming, I figured a new landing page with more content 
would be helpful in spreading the word.

The site is built with 
<a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.com/" target="_blank">Jigsaw by Tighten</a> 
and hosted on <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. 
This process has been incredibly fast and easy to get a site up and going. 
I highly recommend it for any developers familiar with Laravel that wants 
to quickly set up a static site.
